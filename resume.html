    <h2>Education</h2>

    <h3>M.A. Anthropology, GPA 4.0</h3>
    <h4>George Mason University, Fairfax, 2016</h4>
    <p>My Graduate Research Project, <i>Beyond Form N-400: Advanced Citizenship Classes</i>, argued that current citizenship classes promote rote memorization, rather than teaching knowledge and skills. I developed and proposed instructional lessons and materials that utilized Bloom’s Taxonomy to provide naturalizing citizens the confidence and skills to practice and engage in U.S. citizenship.</p>

    <h3>B.A. Anthropology, Minor History, GPA 3.89</h3>
    <h4>George Mason University, Fairfax, 2014</h4>
